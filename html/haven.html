            <p class="paragraph">Haven is a unique three-site map, making it stand out from the standard two-site layout found in most Valorant maps. With A, B, and C bomb sites, teams must carefully manage their rotations and site control. This extra site creates a faster-paced and more dynamic gameplay experience, requiring strong team coordination and map awareness.</p>

            <p class="paragraph">The Mid area plays a crucial role, as controlling it allows teams to rotate quickly between sites. Defenders must spread their resources wisely, while attackers can apply pressure on multiple sites to force defenders into difficult positions. Haven offers a mix of long-range sightlines and tight corners, encouraging a balance between sniper duels and close-quarters combat.</p>

            <p class="paragraph">The map’s traditional Asian architecture, combined with temple-like structures and urban elements, gives it a distinct aesthetic that complements its strategically complex layout.</p>
