        <div class="maps-description">
            <p class="paragraph">Fracture is a highly unique map in Valorant due to its H-shaped layout, where attackers spawn in the middle, while defenders spawn on the sides. This unconventional design allows attackers to split-push sites from multiple directions, forcing defenders to be constantly aware of flanks and rotations.</p>
            <img src="/assets/FRACTURE.png" alt="" class="loading-map">
            <p class="paragraph">The map features two bomb sites (A and B), each with multiple entry points and elevated areas for vertical play. A key feature of Fracture is its ziplines, which run underneath the map, allowing attackers to quickly switch between opposite sides before the round starts. Control over Mid is crucial, as it provides access to both sites and quick rotations for defenders.</p>
            <img src="/assets/Fracture_Top_Down_View.png" alt="" class="topdownview">
            <p class="paragraph">Fracture’s aesthetic is a mix of deserted industrial structures and lush, overgrown vegetation, representing a high-tech research facility that has been overtaken by nature. The split design and numerous entry points make this map one of the most strategically demanding battlegrounds in Valorant.</p>
