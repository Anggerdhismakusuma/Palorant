        <div class="maps-description">
            <p class="paragraph">Icebox is a snow-covered, industrial-themed map set in a frozen tundra, featuring tight corridors, vertical elements, and multiple zip lines. The map is known for its complex site structures, requiring precise movement and well-coordinated team plays to navigate effectively.</p>

            <p class="paragraph">Both A and B bomb sites offer high-ground positions, making vertical engagements crucial. Mid control is also essential, allowing for faster rotations and flanking opportunities. The presence of crates, tunnels, and ziplines creates a dynamic battleground where players must use both elevation and cover to outmaneuver their opponents.</p>

            <p class="paragraph">Icebox’s cold, industrial atmosphere, combined with its dense layout, makes it one of the most challenging maps in Valorant, favoring players who excel in positioning, vertical play, and sharp engagements.</p>
