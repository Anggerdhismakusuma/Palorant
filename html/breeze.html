        <div class="maps-description">
            <p class="paragraph">Breeze is a large, open map set on a tropical island, featuring wide sightlines, open spaces, and minimal choke points. Unlike many other maps in Valorant, Breeze offers a more long-range combat experience, making sniper rifles like the Operator highly effective.</p>
            <img src="/assets/BREEZE.png" alt="" class="loading-map">
            <p class="paragraph">The map consists of two bomb sites (A and B), both of which provide multiple entry points and require strong team coordination to control. A Site is characterized by its pyramids, offering unique cover opportunities, while B Site features a long corridor and high-ground advantage. Mid control is crucial, as it allows for quick rotations and unexpected flanks.</p>
            <img src="/assets/Breeze_Top_Down_View.png" alt="" class="topdownview">
            <p class="paragraph">Breeze also stands out with its coastal theme, featuring sandy beaches, palm trees, and ancient ruins, creating a visually stunning battleground. The mix of wide areas and vertical elements challenges players to adapt their strategies, balancing aggressive peeks with well-planned defenses.</p>
